# Call me by your name 
This is the sad and happy story of how I tried to use a data set about baby names in New York and only realized it was clean once it was too late.

After trying to use the data of baby names published by the NYC Open Data, I started to test the data to see the possible errors.
Closer to the end of my project, I found the package Babynames https://github.com/hadley/babynames that Hadley Wickham created, and life was much easier.

I used the Social Security Administration data, which shows the names of the babies born in the United States from 1880 to 2017.
For privacy, it only shows names with more than five uses. The children of Elon Musk are safe. 

In this project, I learned to manage my frustration when dealing with a dataset that isn't perfect (isn't that always the case?) and look for other options and people who have done something similar. 

I aim to improve my data visualization skills and tell stories in the best way possible.
