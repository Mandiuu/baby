# Call my by your name 
This is the sad and happy story of how I tried to use a data set about baby names in New York and didn't realize it wasn't clean until it was late

After trying to use the data of baby names published by the NYC Open Data, I started to test the data to see the possible errors.
Closer to desist in my project, I found the package Babynames https://github.com/hadley/babynames that Hadley Wickham created and life was much easier.

I used the data from Social Security Administration, that shows the names of the babies born in the United Stated from 1880 to 2017.
For privacy, the only show names with more than 5 uses are given. The sibilings of Elon Musk are safe. 

In this project I learn to manage my frustration when dealing with a dataset that isn't perfect (isn't that always the case?), and also to look for other options and people that probably has done something similar. 

I'm aiming to improve my data visualization skills and tell stories the best way possible
